# Ecosystem gaps: what the main stacks treat as standard and we do not list

Research date: 2026-10-23. Method: GitHub API (stars, pushes, releases), registry APIs (npm, PyPI via pypistats, crates.io, RubyGems, NuGet, Packagist, Hex), READMEs and docs. **No third-party tool was installed or run**, so every claim about behaviour (exit codes, flags) rests on documentation unless marked otherwise.

## How to read the numbers

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Stars | GitHub stars today. Repos that moved show low stars (Sobelow) or are mirrors (html-validate). |
| Downloads | **Units differ by registry; do not compare across ecosystems.** npm and PyPI: last 30 days. Packagist: monthly. crates.io and Hex: last 90 days. RubyGems and NuGet: **all-time** (only useful to rank within one ecosystem). |
| Release | Latest release from the registry or GitHub Releases, with date. `(tag)` = GitHub tags API, which sorts by name, so the date is unknown. GitHub "latest release" is wrong for projects that stopped using it (standard, StyleCop), so registry versions are used there. |

## Decisions that apply everywhere

1. **osv-scanner (already listed) reads these lockfiles**, checked in its docs: `Gemfile.lock`, `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`, `pnpm-lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `composer.lock`, `mix.lock`, `pom.xml`, `gradle.lockfile`, `go.mod`, `packages.lock.json`. So one tool per job means we do **not** add bundler-audit (GPL-3.0), pip-audit, `uv audit`, `composer audit`, mix_audit or OWASP Dependency-Check by default. Rows below say "overlap: osv-scanner".
2. **Plugins and formatters of tools already listed are edits to those entries, not new entries** (see "Edits to existing entries").
3. **Mutation testing** (mutmut, cargo-mutants, Stryker, Infection, PIT) is slow and belongs on a schedule, not on every pull request (see `docs/patterns.md`, "Reporting versus enforcing"). No clear winner is needed per stack; none is proposed.
4. **Library-only tools stay out** (cargo-hack, cargo-semver-checks, publint, arethetypeswrong), as already decided for cargo-semver-checks.

**Recommendations:**

- **strong_migrations** for Rails migrations. It raises during `db:migrate` on locking operations and gives the safe alternative. It works on Ruby migration DSL, so it does not overlap with squawk (SQL files). Limits: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB only; runs at migration time, so CI must run the migrations.
- **Bullet** for N+1 and unused eager loading. Set `Bullet.raise = true` in test so specs fail (README). Limits: finds only what the test suite exercises.
- **i18n-tasks** (`i18n-tasks health`, missing and unused keys, normalised files). The only mature option for Rails; last release is 11 months old but the repo is active.
- **Herb** over erb_lint. erb_lint has had no release since 2025-01; Herb is a C parser with linter, formatter and language server, and the linter has 600k npm downloads a month. Limits: pre-1.0; the formatter is marked experimental; the linter runs from npm (`npx @herb-tools/linter`), so Ruby-only CI needs Node.
- **Sorbet** (with tapioca for gems and Rails) over Steep: about 8x the stars-to-downloads pull, used by Stripe and Shopify. Limits: needs `sig` annotations and a typed-level migration; Steep and RBS are the standard-library direction, so revisit yearly.
- **Packwerk** for package boundaries and privacy. pks is a Rust drop-in about 10-20x faster per its README, but is tiny (10 stars, unverified); name it in the limits.
- **Brakeman**: licence unchanged. `LICENSE.md` is the "Brakeman Public Use License" (copyright Synopsys, 2019): commercial use requires a paid licence; the README says "free for non-commercial use". (A separate `MIT-LICENSE` file in the repo is from a bundled component, not the tool.) It is the only Rails SAST of weight, released 2026-09-30. Keep it in Under review with the licence warning; do not recommend for commercial work.
- **Reject:** reek (style noise, overlaps RuboCop Metrics), rails_best_practices (mostly superseded by rubocop-rails, no release signal since April), erb_lint (superseded), bundler-audit (overlap: osv-scanner, GPL), standard (a config of RuboCop; one tool per job).

Confidence: strong_migrations, Bullet, i18n-tasks high; Packwerk medium; Herb and Sorbet medium (pre-1.0 and heavy to adopt respectively); Brakeman licence high.

**Recommendations:**

- **django-upgrade**: rewrites code to the idioms of your target Django version; `--target-version` and a non-zero exit when it changes files make it a CI check. Narrow but the clear standard (Adam Johnson). Confidence medium-high.
- **django-migration-linter**: Django-specific backward-incompatible migration detection (`lintmigrations`). It is a different job from squawk, which lints SQL; use it with squawk on `sqlmigrate` output only if you want both. Not run by us. Confidence medium.
- **diff-cover** as the language-agnostic coverage ratchet for changed lines (`--fail-under`). It reads Cobertura, JaCoCo, lcov-style XML reports (list of formats: unverified). Better than a global floor because it does not fail old code. Complements the "Coverage ratchet" pattern. Confidence medium.
- **uv**: `uv lock --check` and `uv sync --locked` are built in; document as a pattern, not an entry.
- **import-linter stays**; tach is a Rust option with a fifth of the downloads. No change.
- **Types: no clear winner.** Pyrefly is now 1.4.0 stable (not beta), ty is still 0.0.x. django-stubs works through the mypy plugin; Rust checkers do not run mypy plugins, so Django projects that want model-aware types still need mypy. Update the "Python types" row in Under review.
- **No clear winner:** N+1 for Django (nplusone is dead since 2022; django-perf-rec has 354 stars), mutation testing (mutmut leads, scheduled use only), template lint (djLint is GPL-3.0 and covers many template languages, but formatting overlaps).
- **Reject:** pip-audit (overlap: osv-scanner).

| Mutation | Stryker | stryker-mutator/stryker-js | 3271 | 13.3M | 10.1.1, 2026-10-23 | Apache-2.0 |

**Recommendations:**

- **Stylelint**: the CSS/SCSS standard; Oxlint does no CSS, Biome's CSS rules are narrower. Limits: CSS only; add `stylelint --formatter json` for agents. Confidence high.
- **axe-core** through `@axe-core/playwright` for accessibility in tests (violations fail the test). Static JSX a11y rules already exist inside Oxlint (its `jsx-a11y` plugin is built in per the Oxlint docs); this is the runtime job. Limits: finds roughly the automatable part of WCAG, needs a Playwright suite; MPL-2.0. Confidence high.
- **size-limit** for bundle budgets (fails when a bundle exceeds the limit, also checks time to load). Works for apps and libraries. Confidence medium-high.
- **Lighthouse CI** (`lhci assert` with budgets) for Core Web Vitals regressions. Only mature option, but the last GitHub release is 16 months old while commits continue (npm publish workflow was added 2026-10-23). Flag it in limitations; confidence medium. The job is "no clear winner" if you need a maintained release line.
- **syncpack** over sherif: syncpack is Rust-based since v14 (repo has `Cargo.toml` and `crates/`), has 5x the downloads, and checks version consistency, ranges and formatting; sherif is zero-config and fast but narrower. Limits: monorepos only; package-manager catalogs (pnpm, Bun) reduce the need. Confidence medium.
- **i18next-cli** for i18next projects: `extract --ci` fails if files would change, `status` exits non-zero when translations are missing, `lint` finds hardcoded strings. Only 244 stars, but 3.5M downloads and it is the official i18next tool. Limits: i18next only (Lingui and FormatJS have their own CLIs). Confidence medium.
- **No entry:** html-validate (main repo on GitLab; hold), lockfile-lint (npm and yarn only; its docs say pnpm lockfiles cannot carry the attack; overlap with osv-scanner and `--ignore-scripts` policy), type-coverage (Oxlint and strict TypeScript cover the intent), Stryker (scheduled), madge, Sheriff and eslint-plugin-boundaries (overlap: dependency-cruiser; the last is ESLint-only). Not verified: whether type-coverage and Sheriff work with TypeScript 7.
- **Biome** remains the open alternative toolchain; unchanged.

| Coverage | go-test-coverage | vladopajic/go-test-coverage | 242 | 2.20.1 | GPL-3.0 (already rejected) |

**Recommendations:**

- **go-arch-lint** is the better Go architecture tool today (2x the stars, monthly cadence; arch-go moved repositories and is smaller). Both are small, so confidence is low-medium; keep as a proposal with that flag, and note ArchUnit-like Go rules are also possible with ast-grep (listed).
- **gofumpt**: do not add. `golangci-lint fmt` has `gofumpt` as a formatter (listed in the golangci-lint formatter docs); edit the golangci-lint entry.
- **NilAway**: strong tool (Uber), but it has no releases and runs as a golangci-lint private plugin or standalone, which is heavy to set up. Keep in Under review.
- **deadcode**: reject as an enforcer. Verified by running v0.52.0 (Go 1.26) on a four-function module (2026-10-24): it prints `unreachable func: unused` and exits 0, so it reports and does not fail. The script around it is one line, `out=$(deadcode -test ./...) && [ -z "$out" ]`; the `&&` matters, because `deadcode` does exit 1 when packages fail to load (checked), and `;` would let that pass with empty output. Two flags decide whether the output is usable, both checked in the same run:
  - without `-test`, a function in a non-test file that only tests call is reported as dead;
  - without `-tags`, a function that only a build-tagged test calls (`//go:build integration`) is reported as dead, the same blindness golangci-lint has without `run.build-tags`. Pass every tag the test suite uses.

  It still cannot see a function whose only caller is its own test: `-test` makes that one reachable. Keep it out of the list (it does not fail a build by itself); a wrapper is enough if you want it.
- **sqlc vet** (CEL lint rules for queries) and **`goreleaser check`** are checks inside tools you already use. Document in patterns when the project uses sqlc or GoReleaser; not entries.

**Recommendations:**

- **cargo-machete** for unused dependencies: fast and widely used (10x cargo-shear), CI exit code via `--with-metadata` and non-zero on findings (docs: unverified). It is regex-based, so it can report false positives, which are handled with a `package.metadata.cargo-machete.ignored` list. cargo-shear is the credible newer alternative (AST-based, by the Oxc author, declared feature-complete, also finds unlinked source files); this is a judgement call, flagged. cargo-udeps needs nightly.
- **cargo-nextest**: the practitioner standard test runner (about 3x faster, retries, flaky-test detection, JUnit output). It enforces by failing the test run, so it is a speed and signal tool. Optional entry; confidence medium.
- **cargo-llvm-cov** for coverage floors (`--fail-under-lines`, docs: unverified); preferred to tarpaulin on downloads and on accuracy of LLVM instrumentation.
- **Reject:** cargo-hack (library feature matrices), cargo-vet (needs an audit process and a team; cargo-deny already covers advisories and licences), cargo-mutants (scheduled; a good tool, no entry needed).

(Maven Central search returned stale versions, so these come from GitHub.)

**Recommendations:**

- **NullAway**: add as a companion to the listed error-prone (it runs as an error-prone check, so it is an edit of that entry or a one-line entry). Fails the compile on possible nulls; Uber-scale adopters. Limits: needs `@Nullable` conventions; Kotlin has its own null safety.
- **detekt** for Kotlin (complexity, smells, potential bugs): the de facto standard, 7k stars, active pushes. Stable release is old (1.23.8, Feb 2025) and 2.0 is in alpha since April; say so in limits. ktlint formatting is already reachable through the listed spotless, so no ktlint entry (one tool per job). Confidence medium.
- **Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs: no clear winner.** All are active, but spotless plus error-prone plus ArchUnit already cover format, bug patterns and architecture; Checkstyle adds naming and Javadoc rules, PMD adds a rule set and copy-paste detection, SpotBugs does bytecode flow analysis. Add one only if you need its specific rules.
- **OWASP Dependency-Check:** the repository moved to `dependency-check/DependencyCheck` (v13.0.0); the old `jeremylong` repo is archived (verified). Do not add by default: overlap with osv-scanner (`pom.xml`, `gradle.lockfile`); it needs an NVD API key or updates are "extremely slow" (its README). Use it only when you need CPE matching of jars without coordinates.
- **Konsist**: pre-1.0, overlaps ArchUnit (which already works on Kotlin bytecode). Hold.

**Recommendations:**

- **Roslynator** as the one extra analyzer pack on top of the listed SDK analyzers: 500+ analyzers, builds with `dotnet build -warnaserror`, a NuGet reference so it runs in CI and the IDE. Meziantou is the more opinionated, smaller alternative; the choice between them is a judgement call (confidence medium-low). Limits: analyzers only fail the build when severities are set to error in `.editorconfig`.
- **ArchUnitNET** over NetArchTest (no release since 2021). Pre-1.0, same API ideas as the listed ArchUnit. Confidence medium.
- **No entry:** StyleCop (its stable line is from 2019), SonarAnalyzer (server-oriented), CSharpier (`dotnet format` ships in the SDK; style choice), Stryker.NET (scheduled).

## PHP

| Job | Candidate | Repo | Stars | Downloads | Release | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Automated upgrades | **Rector** | rectorphp/rector | 10474 | 9.4M monthly | 2.7.0, 2026-10-06 | MIT |
| Advisories | `composer audit` | composer/composer | 29559 | built in | 2.10.3, 2026-08-27 | MIT |
| Unused / shadow deps | composer-dependency-analyser | shipmonk-rnd/composer-dependency-analyser | 635 | n/a | 1.8.4, 2025-11-25 | MIT |
| Mutation | Infection | infection/infection | 2263 | 1.9M monthly | 0.35.8, 2026-10-14 | BSD-3-Clause |
| Static analysis (listed) | PHPStan | phpstan/phpstan | 14134 | 16.9M monthly | 2.3.1 | MIT |

**Recommendation: Rector.** `vendor/bin/rector --dry-run` shows the diff and fails (non-zero) when changes are pending (README shows the dry-run; exit code is documented behaviour but unverified by us). It does a different job from Mago: automated framework and PHP version upgrades and refactoring sets. Limits: a rule-set tool, so results depend on the sets you choose; run `--dry-run` in CI, apply locally. Confidence medium-high.
`composer audit`: overlap with osv-scanner. composer-dependency-analyser: hold (small, last release 11 months ago). Infection: scheduled.

## Elixir and Phoenix

| Job | Candidate | Repo | Stars | Downloads (Hex, 90 d) | Release | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lint, style, consistency | **Credo** | rrrene/credo | 5228 | 4.8M | 1.7.19, 2026-06-25 | MIT |
| Phoenix security | **Sobelow** | **sobelow/sobelow** (old nccgroup repo stale since 2024) | 66 (new repo) | 1.7M | 0.16.0, 2026-09-30 | Apache-2.0 |
| Dialyzer wrapper | Dialyxir | jeremyjh/dialyxir | 1796 | 2.9M | 1.4.8, 2026-09-05 | Apache-2.0 |
| Advisories | mix_audit | mirego/mix_audit | 383 | 1.5M | 2.1.5, 2025-06-09 | BSD-3-Clause |

**Recommendations:**

- **Credo**: the standard linter (`mix credo --strict`, JSON output, custom checks). Formatting is built in (`mix format --check-formatted`), as is `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` (and Elixir 1.20 adds more type-system warnings to the compiler). Confidence high.
- **Sobelow**: the Phoenix security scanner. It is alive (v0.16.0 on 2026-09-30 from the new `sobelow/sobelow` repo), so the earlier "old releases" worry is resolved. `--exit low|medium|high` makes it fail the build, `--format sarif|json` for tooling (README). Limits: Phoenix and Plug only; the new repo has few stars because it was moved. Confidence medium-high.
- **Dialyxir: no clear winner.** Dialyzer is slow (PLT builds) and gradual typing in the compiler is evolving; use it if you already do.
- **Reject:** mix_audit (overlap: osv-scanner reads `mix.lock`; `mix hex.audit` covers retired packages, unverified by us).

## Not researched (flag)

C and C++ (clang-tidy, clang-format, cppcheck), Dart and Flutter (`dart analyze` is built in), Scala, Haskell. C/C++ is a real gap given its size; propose a separate pass.

## Edits to existing entries

| Entry | Edit |
|---|---|
| rubocop | Mention rubocop-rails (318M gem downloads), rubocop-rspec (304M), rubocop-performance as the way to cover Rails and RSpec; reject `standard` (config of the same tool), reek, rails_best_practices. |
| golangci-lint | State that `golangci-lint fmt` runs gofumpt, gci and goimports; do not add gofumpt. |
| error-prone | Add NullAway as the null-safety check. |
| osv-scanner | State the lockfile list above so users do not add pip-audit, bundler-audit, mix_audit, composer audit or OWASP Dependency-Check. |
| dependency-cruiser | Note that it covers what madge, Sheriff and eslint-plugin-boundaries do. |
| Under review table | Python types: Pyrefly is 1.4.0 stable. Elixir: Sobelow moved to `sobelow/sobelow` and is active. Kotlin/.NET: ArchUnitNET and detekt can leave the "unverified" bucket if the proposals below are accepted. Ruby: Brakeman stays, with the licence text above. |
| Docs | Add to `docs/patterns.md`: `uv lock --check`, `sqlc vet` and `sqlc diff`, `goreleaser check`, `mix format --check-formatted` and `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`, `composer audit` (scheduled). |

New categories needed in `CATEGORY_ORDER` (`scripts/readme.ts`): **Kotlin**, **Elixir**, **Web quality** (CSS, accessibility, performance budgets) and **Tests and coverage**. All other proposed entries use existing categories (Ruby, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript, Go, Rust, Java, .NET, PHP).

## Proposed README entries

Mark: every entry below was checked by documentation, repository and registry data on 2026-10-23. **Nothing was installed or run.**

### Ruby

- **[strong_migrations](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations)**: stops unsafe Rails migrations (locking indexes, column drops, type changes) while they run and names the safe alternative; 4.4k stars, MIT, active. It checks Ruby migrations, so it does not overlap with squawk. *Limits:* PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB only; runs only when migrations run, so CI must run them.
- **[Bullet](https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet)**: detects N+1 queries and unused eager loading; with `Bullet.raise = true` in test the specs fail. The standard Rails tool (7.3k stars, 188M gem downloads). *Limits:* finds only what tests exercise.
- **[i18n-tasks](https://github.com/glebm/i18n-tasks)**: `i18n-tasks health` fails on missing, unused and inconsistent translation keys and normalises locale files. The mature Rails option. *Limits:* Ruby and Rails; last release 2025-11.
- **[Herb](https://github.com/marcoroth/herb)**: HTML-aware ERB parser with linter and formatter; replaces erb_lint, which has had no release since 2025-01. 600k npm downloads a month. *Limits:* pre-1.0; formatter is experimental; the linter runs through npm.
- **[Sorbet](https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet)**: fast static type checker for Ruby (used by Stripe and Shopify); with tapioca it types gems and Rails. Chosen over Steep for adoption (158M vs 6.9M gem downloads). *Limits:* needs `sig` annotations and gradual strictness levels; Steep with RBS is the other direction.
- **[Packwerk](https://github.com/Shopify/packwerk)**: enforces package dependency and privacy rules in a Rails monolith. *Limits:* needs modularisation work; [pks](https://github.com/rubyatscale/pks) is a Rust drop-in claiming 10-20x speed but is very small (10 stars, unverified).

### Python

- **[django-upgrade](https://github.com/adamchainz/django-upgrade)**: rewrites code to the idioms of your target Django version, and fails CI when files would change. *Limits:* Django only; narrow by design.
- **[django-migration-linter](https://github.com/3YOURMIND/django-migration-linter)**: flags Django migrations that are not backward compatible with the running code (`lintmigrations`); 3.4M downloads a month. *Limits:* Django only; not verified by running; does not replace squawk for lock analysis on SQL.

### JavaScript and TypeScript

- **[syncpack](https://github.com/JamieMason/syncpack)**: Rust tool that enforces one version of each dependency and consistent ranges across a monorepo; 11M downloads a month. *Limits:* monorepos only; package-manager catalogs reduce the need; sherif is the narrower alternative.
- **[i18next-cli](https://github.com/i18next/i18next-cli)**: official i18next CLI; `extract --ci` fails on out-of-date key files, `status` fails on missing translations, `lint` finds hardcoded strings. *Limits:* i18next only; 244 stars, young; not run by us.

### Web quality (new category)

- **[Stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)**: CSS, SCSS and CSS-in-JS linter with autofix and custom rules; 44M downloads a month. Oxlint does no CSS. *Limits:* CSS only.
- **[axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core)**: accessibility rules that fail tests when run through `@axe-core/playwright` (53M downloads a month). Static JSX checks are in Oxlint. *Limits:* finds only the automatable part of WCAG; needs a browser test suite; MPL-2.0.
- **[size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)**: fails the build when a bundle is over its size or load-time budget. *Limits:* needs a build step and budgets chosen by you.
- **[Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci)**: asserts performance, accessibility and best-practice budgets per pull request. The only mature option. *Limits:* last GitHub release 2025-06 (commits continue); lab data varies between runs.

### Tests and coverage (new category)

- **[diff-cover](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover)**: fails when coverage of the lines changed in a pull request is under a threshold; reads coverage reports from many languages. Better than a global floor. *Limits:* needs a coverage report; supported report formats not verified.

### Go

- **[go-arch-lint](https://github.com/fe3dback/go-arch-lint)**: enforces package dependency rules from a YAML file; the more active of the two Go options (arch-go is smaller). *Limits:* small project (616 stars); low confidence.

### Rust

- **[cargo-machete](https://github.com/bnjbvr/cargo-machete)**: finds unused dependencies quickly (594k downloads in 90 days). *Limits:* regex-based, so false positives are possible; [cargo-shear](https://github.com/Boshen/cargo-shear) is a more accurate newer alternative.
- **[cargo-nextest](https://github.com/nextest-rs/nextest)**: the standard test runner: faster, retries flaky tests, JUnit output. *Limits:* a speed and signal tool; does not run doctests.
- **[cargo-llvm-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov)**: coverage with a fail-under threshold using LLVM instrumentation. *Limits:* needs the llvm-tools component; flag names not verified.

### Java

- **[NullAway](https://github.com/uber/NullAway)**: compile-time null checks as an error-prone plugin; fails the build on possible null dereferences. *Limits:* needs `@Nullable` discipline; build with error-prone.

### Kotlin (new category)

- **[detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt)**: Kotlin static analysis for complexity, smells and bugs, with baselines and SARIF. The de facto standard. *Limits:* stable release 1.23.8 is from 2025-02 and 2.0 is in alpha; ktlint formatting comes through spotless.

### .NET

- **[Roslynator](https://github.com/dotnet/roslynator)**: 500+ extra analyzers on top of the SDK analyzers, enforced with `-warnaserror` and `.editorconfig` severities. *Limits:* only fails when you set severities to error; Meziantou.Analyzer is the smaller alternative.
- **[ArchUnitNET](https://github.com/TNG/ArchUnitNET)**: architecture rules as unit tests, the .NET sibling of ArchUnit; NetArchTest has had no release since 2021. *Limits:* pre-1.0.

### PHP

- **[Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector)**: automated upgrades and refactoring sets; `--dry-run` in CI shows pending changes. A different job from Mago. *Limits:* depends on the rule sets you choose; fail-on-diff behaviour read from the docs only.

### Elixir (new category)

- **[Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo)**: the standard Elixir linter (consistency, readability, refactoring opportunities, custom checks); use with `mix format --check-formatted` and `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`. *Limits:* style and smell rules, not type checking.
- **[Sobelow](https://github.com/sobelow/sobelow)**: security scanner for Phoenix; `--exit` fails the build at a confidence level, SARIF output. Active again (0.16.0, 2026-09-30) after moving to this repository. *Limits:* Phoenix and Plug only; heuristic findings need a `.sobelow-skips` file.
